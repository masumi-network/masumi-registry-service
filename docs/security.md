# Security Guidelines

## Overview

The Masumi Registry Service handles the registration aggregation of MASUMI AI Nodes.

## Security Best Practices

### Service Security

1. **Network Security**

   - Expose the service to public networks only if necessary
   - Otherwise use secure VPN or private network access
   - Implement necessary firewall rules

2. **Access Control**

   - Implement minimal role-based access control
   - Use strong API key authentication
   - Ensure API key confidentiality

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Secure key management
   - Regular backup procedures

### Maintenance

1. **Updates**

   - Deploy regular security patches
   - Version control monitoring
   - Dependency updates

2. **Monitoring**

   - Check usage of the service to ensure it is not being abused

## Auditing

- Smart contracts are (currently) audited by [TxPipe](https://txpipe.io/)
- The payment service is not yet audited by a third Party. Do check the codebase before exposing it publicly

We follow security best practices, however this is in a MVP state. Any use is at your own risk.
